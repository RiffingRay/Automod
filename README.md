# Surrendren
The source code for the Surrendren automod.

Surrendren2 is the older but more robust version. It was what was running on the server before I stepped down as developer. It's a mess, but it works.

Surrendren3's a massive cleanup, but I never properly tested it, so it could have extra glitches or problems that Surrendren2 doesn't.

Only intentional change is 3 only accepts commands from the Bot Commands channel, and only deletes voice channels when they become empty.

Otherwise, 3 should work exactly like 2.

Requires Windows 8 or higher (apparently, it can be run on 7, but with some fancy websocket tinkering that I could never get working) and .Net Core 1.1.

Do whatever you want with it, just don't blame me if it fucks up, and give credit if you do anything with it.
